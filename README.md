Enabling Autonomous Mobility and Health  Monitoring for Wheelchair Users: An Implementation of Voice and Android App Controlled System

ABSTRACT
Accidents, diseases, and the challenges that come with aging can transform a person's desire for a normal life into a state of disability. The number of individuals living with disabilities, including physical handicaps and paralysis, is steadily growing. These individuals often rely on the assistance of others to move and perform daily activities. They may also require physical therapy to regain strength and mobility. While the journey of living with a disability can be challenging, the collective efforts of medical advancements, assistive technologies, rehabilitation therapies, and societal changes are continuously improving the lives of people with disabilities. The aim is to empower individuals to live to their fullest potential, overcome limitations, and achieve a sense of normalcy in their lives.

The project is focused on creating a smart and motorized wheelchair that can be controlled through voice commands and an Android app. It is specifically designed to cater to the needs of physically disabled individuals while still providing the option for manual operation. The wheelchair utilizes embedded systems technology to enable voice activation and control through an Android app. The user can give commands using their voice or through the dedicated app installed on a Bluetooth-enabled cellular device. The BT Voice Control for Arduino converts the voice or app commands into strings and transfers them to the Arduino board, which is connected to a Bluetooth Module HC-05. This Bluetooth module facilitates the control of the wheelchair's movements. For example, when the user utters the command "FORWARD," the wheelchair will move in the forward direction. Similarly, commands like "REVERSE," "LEFT," "RIGHT," and "STOP" control the respective movements of the wheelchair. To ensure safety and obstacle detection, an ultrasonic sensor is incorporated into the design. This sensor detects obstacles lying ahead and alerts the user or autonomously stops the wheelchair to prevent any potential collisions or hindrances. Furthermore, the project includes an autonomous system for monitoring the user's heart rate and temperature. This feature helps track the user's health and well-being while using the wheelchair. The main objective of this project is to provide an affordable, efficient, and energy-saving solution for physically disabled individuals. By incorporating voice and app control, obstacle detection, and health monitoring, the project aims to enhance the independence, comfort, and safety of the wheelchair users, ultimately improving their quality of life.
